# Batman: Sword of Azrael (1992-) #1
## Blurb
It will prove to be one of Batman's most challenging adventures as a new hero joins the Dark Knight's continuing cast of characters in BATMAN: SWORD OF AZRAEL. Azrael is the enforcer for the secret Order of Saint Dumas, a society whose existence dates back to the time of the Crusades. When this bullet-riddled angel of death crashes into the midst of a Gotham City parade, Batman is drawn into the mystery of Azrael, launching them on a quest that leads both Batman and the young Azrael to Europe where they separately investigate the systematic slaying of the members of the Order of Saint Dumas.

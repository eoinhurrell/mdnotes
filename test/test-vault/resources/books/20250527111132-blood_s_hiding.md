# Blood's Hiding
## Blurb
A century ago across the land of Lethia, magic vanished. The Empire's four Kinds vie for power through drought, famine, and a nascent war. Siblings Kettra and Ryn Dawneye live a hard life among the poor, but a mysterious thief inspires them to journey to the city of Eris Eld-where they struggle to survive aristocracy's schemes and the pull of a powerful cult. Will Keth's great and terrible power be resurrected? Who-or what-will rewrite Lethia's history?

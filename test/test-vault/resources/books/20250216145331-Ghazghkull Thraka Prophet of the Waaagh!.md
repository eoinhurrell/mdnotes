# Ghazghkull Thraka: Prophet of the Waaagh
## Blurb
Ghazghkull Thraka, the Beast of Armageddon, is one of the greatest threats to the Imperium. For the first time, read his full story… as told to the Inquisition by his faithful banner bearer Makari. Of the billions of greenskins who swarm the galaxy, only the name of one strikes fear into the hearts of human and xenos alike: Ghazghkull Mag Uruk Thraka. The Warlord of Warlords. The Beast of Armageddon. The Prophet of the Waaagh! With his tusks and fists and power claw, he does the holy work of Gork and Mork, and soon all worlds will burn in his boot prints. Mystery shrouds how such a beast came to exist, and rumours abound that the mighty warlord was once just like any other ork. But if that is the case, how did his ascendance come to be? Many have lost their minds trying to unravel the mystery. Lord Inquisitor Tytonida Falx has headed into the murky depths of heresy to find the answer, only this time, something is different. She possesses something the others did not. Custody of the one creature in the universe who claims to know the truth of it all. Ghazghkull’s banner bearer: Makari the Grot.
